Random project ideas I want to remember. Some of these are probably bad, but I want to capture them before I forget.

## Technical Projects

**SEC Filing Analyzer**
Build something that parses 10-K and 10-Q filings to extract key metrics and flag unusual changes. Could use LLMs to summarize risk factors and compare year-over-year. Would combine my econ interest with NLP.

**Local-First Notes App**
I'm frustrated with how all note apps require accounts and sync to someone else's server. What if there was a notes app that stored everything locally but could optionally sync peer-to-peer? CRDTs for conflict resolution?

**Economic Indicator Dashboard**
Pull data from FRED, display it with good visualizations. The existing tools (like FRED itself) are ugly and hard to navigate. Could be a good portfolio piece.

**Code Review Bot**
Train a model (or fine-tune an existing one) on good code review comments. Help catch issues in PRs before human reviewers spend time on them. Would need to be careful about false positives.

## Smaller Things

- CLI tool to manage dotfiles across machines
- Browser extension that tracks time spent on different sites (for my own awareness)
- Script to automatically organize my Downloads folder
- Telegram bot that sends me daily economic news summaries

## Learning Projects (For Practice, Not Portfolio)

- Reimplement a simple database to understand B-trees and transaction isolation
- Build a tiny compiler for a made-up language
- Write a basic HTTP server from scratch in C or Rust

## Questions Before Starting Any Project

1. Who would actually use this?
2. How is it better than existing solutions?
3. What will I learn from building it?
4. Can I finish it in a reasonable timeframe?
5. Will it help my career/portfolio?

Not every project needs to check all boxes, but I should be intentional about which ones matter for each project.

## What I Should Actually Do

Pick ONE thing and finish it. My graveyard of half-finished projects isn't helping anyone. Maybe the SEC analyzer—it's at the intersection of my interests and could be genuinely useful.

Setting a deadline: have a working prototype by end of February. Something deployed, even if rough.
