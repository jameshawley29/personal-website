Went to the CS department's welcome back event tonight. Talked to some upperclassmen about their summer internships—one worked on ML infrastructure at Google, another did backend systems at Stripe. They talked about their work like it was obvious, like of course they understood how to design systems at scale.

And I nodded along, but inside I was panicking. Do I even belong here?

I can write code that works. I can pass my classes. But when they talk about "building distributed systems" or "optimizing model training pipelines," I feel like I'm missing something fundamental that everyone else has.

## What I Know Logically

Imposter syndrome is well documented. Most people feel this way. The students who seem confident are often just better at hiding their uncertainty. Comparing myself to people two years ahead of me isn't fair.

## What I Feel Emotionally

Like I got into UVA by mistake. Like every good grade is luck. Like eventually someone will notice I don't actually know what I'm doing.

## What Usually Helps

- Looking back at things I've built that actually work
- Remembering how confused I was about things that seem obvious now (recursion used to break my brain)
- Talking to my friend Alex who admits she feels the same way
- Getting off social media where everyone is posting their wins

## Current Plan

1. Stop comparing my beginning to their middle
2. Apply for internships anyway, even if I don't feel ready
3. Focus on learning, not on proving I already know things
4. Remember that "not knowing yet" and "can't learn" are different

This is a note I'm writing to myself. If future me finds this: you've felt this way before. You got through it. You'll get through it again.

The discomfort of not knowing is part of learning. If everything felt easy, you wouldn't be growing.

(Also: maybe talk to someone about this? The counseling center exists for a reason.)
