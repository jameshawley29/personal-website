Another semester down. Sitting in my apartment with the snow falling outside, thinking about how much has changed since August.

## The Good

Finally clicked with data structures. Not just memorizing the operations but actually understanding *why* you'd choose a hash map over a tree, when a heap makes sense, the tradeoffs between time and space complexity. The algorithms class that seemed impossible in September started feeling manageable by November.

The econometrics project went well. Working with real data (unemployment stats by county) made the regression models feel less abstract. When I ran my first successful regression and could actually interpret the coefficients, it was satisfying in a way I didn't expect.

Made some actual friends in the econ major. Study groups helped, but more than that, just having people to talk through problem sets with made the harder classes bearable. Turns out other people are confused too.

## The Hard

That operating systems midterm was a wake-up call. Got a C+. First time in college a test genuinely kicked my ass. Had to accept that coasting on high school habits wouldn't work anymore.

Time management is still a struggle. I keep thinking I'll get better at it, but then I'm still pulling an all-nighter before a deadline. Something has to change next semester.

Homesickness hit harder than expected around Thanksgiving. Coming back to an empty apartment while seeing everyone's family photos online was rough.

## Ideas I'm Mulling

- Should I try for a summer internship in fintech? The personal finance project made me realize I actually like building things with financial data
- Want to get better at technical writing. Started this blog thing but haven't been consistent
- Need to read more. I keep buying books and not finishing them

## Next Semester Goals

1. Start assignments when they're assigned, not the night before
2. Go to office hours when I'm stuck instead of struggling alone for hours
3. Maintain the friendships I've made instead of letting them fade
4. Actually use the gym membership I'm paying for

I'm trying to be honest with myself here. Some things went well, some didn't. The point is to notice patterns and do better next time.

Spring should be interesting. Taking that distributed systems elective I've been curious about, plus intermediate macro. Feels like the pieces of my major are starting to connect.

For now, enjoying the break. Reading, sleeping, trying not to think about grades too much.
