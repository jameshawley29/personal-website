I picked up *Chip War* expecting a straightforward history of the semiconductor industry. What I got was a masterclass in how technology, economics, and geopolitics intertwine in ways that most people—including most people in tech—don't fully appreciate.

Chris Miller's central argument is deceptively simple: semiconductors are the most important technology of our era, and the ability to produce advanced chips has become a determining factor in global power. But the way he builds this argument, tracing the industry from its origins in postwar America through the complex web of companies, countries, and decisions that shaped it, is genuinely illuminating.

## What Makes This Book Work

Miller does something difficult: he makes supply chains interesting. The section on ASML, the Dutch company that has a near-monopoly on the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines necessary for cutting-edge chip production, reads like a thriller. The technical challenges involved in focusing light at wavelengths of 13.5 nanometers to etch patterns onto silicon are almost absurdly complex, and Miller explains them clearly without dumbing them down.

The historical sections are equally strong. I knew vaguely that the US semiconductor industry had shifted manufacturing to Asia over the past few decades, but I didn't understand the specific decisions and incentives that drove that shift. Miller traces how Morris Chang's vision for TSMC created an entirely new business model—the pure-play foundry—that would eventually make Taiwan the most important piece of real estate in the global technology supply chain.

## The Economics Angle

As someone studying economics, I found the sections on industrial policy particularly interesting. The semiconductor industry complicates simple narratives about free markets versus government intervention. Yes, private companies drove most of the innovation. But government procurement (especially from the military), research funding, and strategic trade policy all played crucial roles at various points.

The current moment is especially fascinating. The CHIPS Act, export controls on advanced chips to China, the race to build fabrication capacity outside Taiwan—these are massive interventions in a global market, driven by security concerns that are inseparable from economic ones. Miller provides the context necessary to understand why policymakers are making these choices, even if he's careful not to advocate too strongly for any particular approach.

## What I Wish It Had More Of

My main critique is that the book sometimes moves too quickly through recent developments. The AI boom has made advanced chips even more strategically important since Miller finished writing, and some sections feel slightly dated. This isn't really the author's fault—the industry moves fast—but it does mean readers should supplement with more recent reporting.

I also would have appreciated more on the environmental dimensions of semiconductor manufacturing. Chip fabs are incredibly water-intensive, and as the industry expands, questions about sustainability will become harder to ignore.

## Who Should Read This

If you work in tech and don't understand why everyone suddenly cares about TSMC and ASML, read this book. If you're interested in US-China relations and want to understand the technological dimension, read this book. If you're an economics student who wants a case study in how global supply chains actually work, read this book.

*Chip War* is one of those rare books that made me feel like I understood the world slightly better after finishing it. The semiconductor industry isn't just interesting for its own sake—it's a lens through which to see some of the most important dynamics shaping the 21st century.

**Rating: 9/10** — Essential reading for understanding modern technology and geopolitics.
